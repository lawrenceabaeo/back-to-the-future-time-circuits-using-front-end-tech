This app only helps you pretend to time travel. \r\n\r\n##Why did I make this?\r\nI wanted to do a project with broader appeal compared to the anime projects I made. ([See my portfolio for those anime projects](http://lawrenceabaeo.github.io))\r\n\r\nNOTE: There are a TON of Time Circuit projects already, including people making real life working props (google for those props, they are amazing). What makes mine different? I’m not relying on a direct screenshot to skin the box (I found a free metal mottled texture to use). The tech stack for mine is all front-end web related (other projects are native apps, like specifically for Windows, or just the iphone).\r\n\r\n##What technology skills were learned/retrieved?\r\nFront End\r\n\r\n##What are this project’s limitations?\r\n* Still under construction, lots of bugs and things not implemented yet ([issues can be seen here](https://github.com/lawrenceabaeo/back-to-the-future-time-circuits-using-front-end-tech/issues))\r\n* No dial pad. Making a dial pad like in the movie would triple or quadruple project time. Currently exploring input options for destination and last time departed areas. \r\n* Fixed size. I explored a design that would resize on the fly, but ran into issues with font resizing. \r\n* Backlit design: The ‘hardware’ is always a gray silver because of the backlit display of the monitor. I wrote an enhancement request to myself asking to style a ‘dark’ version that looks better when you want to display this thing inside of a car at night. \r\n* Not-exact LCD font. There’s some interesting movie history to this (the movie uses some custom LCD lettering), so I had to find an LCD font that was as close in spirit to it. \r\n\r\n##Tech\r\n* [moment.js](http://momentjs.com/) - this project uses moment.js to make formatting the date so much easier than if I had to roll my own. From [http://momentjs.com/](http://momentjs.com/)\r\n* Other: jQuery, SASS, Brackets editor, GIMP, HTML5 bolierplate\r\n\r\n##Fonts\r\n*  LCD MONO, from: [http://www.dafont.com/lcd-lcd-mono.font](http://www.dafont.com/lcd-lcd-mono.font)\r\n\r\n* Microgramma D OT Medium Extended font, from: [http://fontsup.com/font/microgramma-d-ot-medium-extended.html](http://fontsup.com/font/microgramma-d-ot-medium-extended.html)\r\n\r\n##Other\r\n* Mottled metal texture graphic is from here: [http://insightdesigns.co.uk/blog/2010/05/23/free-texture-grab-grunge-and-scratch-overlays/](http://insightdesigns.co.uk/blog/2010/05/23/free-texture-grab-grunge-and-scratch-overlays/)","google":"UA-67497554-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
